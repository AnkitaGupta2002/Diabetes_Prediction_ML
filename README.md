# Diabetes Prediction Model

Welcome to the Diabetes Prediction Model project! This machine learning project aims to predict the likelihood of diabetes in an individual based on various health parameters. The project is developed using Python and Jupyter Notebook, and it utilizes a dataset from Kaggle containing 2000 samples for training and evaluation.


## Features

The primary goal of this project is to create a predictive model that can assist in early detection of diabetes by analyzing input features such as blood sugar levels, blood pressure, and other relevant health indicators.

- User Input: The model accepts user inputs for health parameters like blood sugar levels, blood pressure, etc., which are crucial factors in determining the risk of diabetes.

- Prediction: Using the trained machine learning model, the application predicts whether an individual is likely to have diabetes or not based on the provided input features.

- Dataset: The dataset used for training and evaluation contains 2000 samples, providing a diverse set of data to build an effective prediction model.


## Dataset

The dataset used for training and evaluating the model is obtained from Kaggle. It consists of 2000 samples with various features that contribute to diabetes prediction. The dataset is preprocessed to handle missing values, outliers, and any necessary feature engineering.
## Tech Stack

1. Python: The entire project, including data preprocessing, model building, and application, is implemented using the Python programming language.

2. Jupyter Notebook: Jupyter Notebook is used to create an interactive and well-documented environment for developing and experimenting with the machine learning model.

3. Scikit-Learn: The Scikit-Learn library is utilized for data preprocessing, model selection, training, and evaluation.

4. Pandas and NumPy: These libraries are used for data manipulation and handling numerical operations efficiently.


## Usage

1. Clone or download the Diabetes Prediction Model repository to your local machine.

2. Open the Jupyter Notebook file (diabetes_prediction.ipynb) using Jupyter Notebook or a compatible environment.

3. Run each cell in the notebook sequentially to perform data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.

4. In the designated cell, input the health parameters for prediction, such as blood sugar levels, blood pressure, etc.

5. The notebook will generate a prediction indicating whether the individual is likely to have diabetes or not.
